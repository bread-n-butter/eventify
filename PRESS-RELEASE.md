## Heading ##

Take part in a group adventure and make the fun affordable for everyone!

## Sub-Heading ##

Adventurous, fun-loving people can easily bring friends or strangers together to do fun things that would otherwise be too expensive to do alone.

## Summary ##

Have you ever wanted to book a sunset sailing charter but thought it was too expensive to do alone? Want to get a group of people together to skydive? Eventify is a hub for recruiting friends (and potential new friends!) to take part in awesome events and adventures. You can post your event on Eventify and allow friends or strangers to join, making the price of fun affordable for everyone.

## Problem ##

Activities or event bookings can be too expensive to do alone - for example, a personalized small-group sightseeing tour, a day sail, or visiting one of those mystery puzzle rooms. Sometimes, you want to take part in an adventure like one of those but don't have the funds to book out the entire activity alone.

## Solution ##

Eventify makes it easier to bring people together who want to take part in an activity that's too expensive to book alone. We create a central location to get your friends to join an activity that you've been wanting to try.

## Quote from You ##

"We want to make it easier for people to organize fun activities with their friends, and also find other fun activities to join that might create new friendships."

## How to Get Started ##

Sign up with Facebook and post your event. As soon as it's posted, anyone can see and join. You'll be able to set what the minimum number of attendees is, and see updated information on how many people have joined your event.

## Customer Quote ##

"I've organized a few events with Eventify, and I've taken part in a few that have been organized by friends, as well as some that were organized by complete strangers. It was a blast! I've made some great new friendships and gotten to go skydiving, hot air ballooning and rented out an entire laser tag facility with a group -- all things I would not have wanted to do alone!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##

Organize a new adventure, or take part in one that's been created. Try new things! You can have fun and save money at the same time with Eventify.
